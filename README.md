Capacitive replacement PCB for the IBM M50.

I have tested this in my own M50. I ordered it from JLCPCB with 0.6mm thickness. 

It is designed to be used with the SMD Model F Controller: https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?t=24597

I used the "standard" version of the controller, and it fit in the bottom case.

You must have some sort of insulation between the bottom of the PCB and the plate. I cut an insulating layer out a sheet of 0.1mm PVC purchased from here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095N7TMZH

**You MUST ground the backplate to the controller** - this is not shown in the image below.
